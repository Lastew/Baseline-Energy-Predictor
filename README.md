# Abstract
This is my capstone project on great energy predictor. I built a special kind of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) called "Long Short Term Memory" networks -usually just called "LSTMs", which is capable of learning long-term dependencies in time series analysis. I was able to predict the energy consumption of the case study office building at 14.7% error.
I trained my model on google cloud 8-CPU xxxxx using the Keras API with the TensorFlow backend.
# Motivation

The buildings sector accounts for about 76%* of electricity use and 40% of all U.S. primary energy use and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Reducing the energy consumption in buildings in order to meet national energy and environmental challenges and to reduce costs to building owners and tenants become crucial.
"Pay-for-performance" (P4P) programs track and rewards energy savings as they occur as opposed to the more common approach of estimating savings in advance of installation and offering upfront rebates or incentives in a lump-sum payment. This is the reason why this capstone project cames in handy in predicting the baseline energy consumption.

I get the Dataset from kaggle compition organized by ASHERE

# Preprocessing
LSTM model requires a three-dimentional input and

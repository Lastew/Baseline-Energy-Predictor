# Abstract:
The buildings sector accounts for about 76%* of electricity use and 40% of all U.S. primary energy use and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Reducing the energy consumption of buildings to meet national energy and environmental challenges is crucial in the 21st century.

This Data Science capstone project is designed to predict the baseline energy consumption for an office building. A special kind of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) called "Long Short Term Memory" networks -usually just called "LSTMs" is used to train a deep learning model that is capable of learning long-term dependencies in sequential data analysis. The LSTM model was able to predict the baseline energy consumption at 14.7% Mean Squared Percent Error.

The model is trained using the Keras API with TensorFlow on Google Cloud with 8xCpu and 30GM RAM.


# Motivation:
One, among many energy efficiency programs, is "Pay-for-performance", which is commonly abbreviated as P4P. P4P incentive program track and rewards end side energy use reduction as they occur as opposed to the more common approach of estimating the reduction in advance of installation and offering upfront rebates in a lump-sum payment.

This project will address the problem and not the fairness of basing energy consumption at the start of energy efficiency improvement measures.

# Data Source:
The data is adopted from a kaggle competition organized by ASHERE. The data source contains 1449 buildings located in different parts of the world.
